I am a self-starter, curious thinker, and strong leader with a history of solving unique challenges. I have a track record of success bringing new enterprise products to market with direct results in sales, enablement, product marketing, and engineering. As a seasoned engineer I now consult on best practices for performance engineering, people process improvement, and adoption of emergent technologies like IoT. Most recently I am focused on my team of leaders @ AppD and helping them influence at a global scale.


I am always open to discussing interesting opportunities to **consult on, participate in,** or **invest in** new ventures.
